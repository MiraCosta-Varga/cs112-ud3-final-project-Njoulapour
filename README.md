# Unit Deliverable 3 - Final Project


// Veronika Joulapour


// Title: Mob Psycho 100 Game Simulator: Cooking Edition!


// Inspired by the animanga series Mob Psycho 100, which is both my favorite anime and manga series. I initially wanted to make a more intricate game simulation but later realized it is incredibly time-consuming so I settled for a funny, smaller one instead. There are 18 text options all which lead to 2 possible outcomes. I will be sharing my wireframing and UMI below in a google drive link.
